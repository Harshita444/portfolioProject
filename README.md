COVID-19 Data Exploration Project:

Objective: Conducted comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data to derive insights into infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.
Skills Utilized: Leveraged advanced SQL techniques including joins, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Temp Tables, Window Functions, and Aggregate Functions. Created Views to store intermediate results for visualization and further analysis.
Key Analyses:
Calculated mortality rates and infection rates for various countries and continents.
Identified countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.
Analyzed vaccination progress by calculating the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
Generated global COVID-19 statistics including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.
Data Sources: Utilized COVID-19 datasets stored in the PortfolioProject database, encompassing information on cases, deaths, population, and vaccinations.
Outcome: Provided valuable insights into the impact of COVID-19 across different regions, aiding in understanding disease dynamics and informing public health interventions.
